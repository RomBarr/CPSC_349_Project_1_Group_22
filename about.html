            We are in Group 22 for Fall CPSC 349-01
            This is Project 1 and is an introduction to what we've covered in class so far.
            Using Pexels, we are using their API to provide a showcase of their stock photos.
            With the help of Eleventy, a static website generator, our team is able to generate 
            multiple pages of photos focused on people studying.
